transport
The enrichment of transport function of COG categories G, I and Q was also reflected in the high number of HGT assigned to KEGG pathways C_02000 (Transport) and C_02010 (ABC transporters). 
Specific transport functions identified cover the metabolites 

glycerol-3-phosphate (permease component of ABC transporter, COG1653), 
sugars (permease component of ABC transporter, COG1175 & K02027), 
peptide or nickel (permease component of ABC transporter, COG0601 & K02035), 
branched amino acid (permease component of ABC transporter, COG0410 & K01996), 
mannitol (periplasmic compound of the TRAP-type transporter)  and 
ammonium                        (K03320, COG0004).
